# pygltflib

Python library for reading, writing and handling GLTF files. Python3.6+

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* dataclasses
* dataclasses-json
* pytest (optional)


## About
This is an unofficial library that tracks the [official file format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md) for GLTF2. 

The library was initially built to load and save simple meshes but support for the entire spec, including materials 
and animations is pretty good. Supports both json (.gltf) and binary (.glb) file formats, although .glb support 
is missing some features at the moment. 

Check the table below for an idea of which sample models validate.

We are very interested in hearing your use cases for `pygltflib` to help drive the roadmap.

######Roadmap:
* Add helper functions for creating meshes
* Full support for binary GLTF (.glb) files
* Reject file overwrites unless overwrite flag set
* Give options on storing binary buffers (embedded vs external)


######Contributors:
* Luke Miller
* Sebastian HÃ¶ffner


######Changelog:
* 1.4 
    * basic support for saving to binary GLTF (.glb) files
    * moved undocumented non-core methods to `pygltfib.utils`
* 1.3 
    * basic support for reading binary GLTF (.glb) files
* 1.2 
    * better json support
    * remove numpy requirement
    * suppress infer warning
    * basic default methods
* 1.0 
    * initial release


## Install

### PIP

###### Method 1
`pip install pygltflib` 

###### Method 2
`python -m pip install pygltflib`

###### Method 3
`py -3 -m pip install pygltflib`


### Source

`git clone https://gitlab.com/dodgyville/pygltflib`

## Usage
Note: These examples use the official [sample models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models) provided by Kronos at:

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

### Creating
```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2, Scene
>>> gltf = GLTF2()
>>> gltf.scene # no scene set by default
>>> len(gltf.scenes)
0

>>> scene = Scene()
>>> gltf.scenes.append(scene)
>>> len(gltf.scenes)
1

```

### Loading and saving

`pygltflib` can load json-based .GLTF files and binary .GLB files, based on the file extension. 

#### GLTF files

```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2
>>> filename = "glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/AnimatedCube/glTF/AnimatedCube.gltf"
>>> gltf = GLTF2().load(filename)
>>> gltf.scene
0

>>> gltf.scenes
[Scene(name='', nodes=[0])]

>>> gltf.nodes[0]
Node(mesh=0, skin=None, rotation=[0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0], translation=[], scale=[], children=[], matrix=[], camera=None, name='AnimatedCube')
>>> gltf.nodes[0].name
'AnimatedCube'

>>> gltf.meshes[0].primitives[0].attributes
Attributes(NORMAL=4, POSITION=None, TANGENT=5, TEXCOORD_0=6)

>>> filename2 = "test.gltf"
>>> gltf.save(filename2)

```

#### GLB files 

```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2
>>> glb_filename = "glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/Box/glTF-Binary/Box.glb"
>>> glb = GLTF2().load(glb_filename)
>>> glb.scene
0

>>> glb.scenes
[Scene(name='', nodes=[0])]

>>> glb.nodes[0]
Node(mesh=None, skin=None, rotation=[], translation=[], scale=[], children=[1], matrix=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], camera=None, name=None)

>>> glb.meshes[0].primitives[0].attributes
Attributes(POSITION=2, NORMAL=1, TANGENT=None, TEXCOORD_0=None, TEXCOORD_1=None, COLOR_0=None, JOINTS_0=None, WEIGHTS_0=None)

>>> glb.save("test.glb")


```

#### Converting files
```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2

>>> # convert glb to gltf
>>> glb = GLTF2().load("glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/Box/glTF-Binary/Box.glb")
>>> glb.save("test.gltf")

>>> # convert gltf to glb
>>> glb = GLTF2().load("glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/Box/glTF/Box.gltf")
>>> glb.save("test.glb")


```
