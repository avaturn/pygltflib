# pygltflib

Python library for reading, writing and handling GLTF files. Python3.6+

## Requirements
* Python 3.6
* dataclasses
* dataclasses-json
* numpy


## About
This is an unofficial library that tracks the [official file format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md) for GLTF2. 

The library was initially built to load and save simple meshes but support for the entire spec, including materials 
and animations is pretty good. 
Check the table below for an idea of which sample models validate.

Changelog:
* 1.0 initial release.
* 1.2 better json support, remove numpy requirement, suppress infer warning, basic default methods.
* 1.3 basic support for reading binary GLTF (.glb) files.

Roadmap:
* Add helper functions for creating meshes
* Full support for binary GLTF (.glb) files.

## Install

### PIP

##### Method 1
`pip install pygltflib` 

##### Method 2
`python -m pip install pygltflib`

##### Method 3
`py -3 -m pip install pygltflib`


### Source

git clone https://gitlab.com/dodgyville/pygltflib

## Usage
Note: These examples use the official [sample models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models) provided by Kronos at:

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

### Creating
```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2, Scene
>>> gltf = GLTF2()
>>> gltf.scene # no scene set by default
>>> len(gltf.scenes)
0

>>> scene = Scene()
>>> gltf.scenes.append(scene)
>>> len(gltf.scenes)
1

```

### Loading and saving

`pygltflib` can load json-based .GLTF files and binary .GLB files, based on the file extension.
Support for *saving* files loaded from .GLB is currently not fully implemented. 

#### GLTF files

```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2
>>> filename = "glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/AnimatedCube/glTF/AnimatedCube.gltf"
>>> gltf = GLTF2().load(filename)
>>> gltf.scene
0

>>> gltf.scenes
[Scene(name='', nodes=[0])]

>>> gltf.nodes[0]
Node(mesh=0, name='AnimatedCube', rotation=[0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0])

>>> gltf.nodes[0].name
'AnimatedCube'

>>> gltf.meshes[0].primitives[0].attributes
Attributes(NORMAL=4, POSITION=None, TANGENT=5, TEXCOORD_0=6)

>>> filename2 = "test.gltf"
>>> gltf = GLTF2().save(filename2)

```

#### GLB files 

```python3
>>> from pygltflib import GLTF2
>>> glb_filename = "glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/Box/glTF-Binary/Box.glb"
>>> glb = GLTF2().load(glb_filename)
>>> glb.scene
0

>>> glb.scenes
[Scene(name='', nodes=[0])]

>>> glb.nodes[0]
Node(mesh=0, name='AnimatedCube', rotation=[0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0])

>>> glb.nodes[0].name
'AnimatedCube'

>>> glb.meshes[0].primitives[0].attributes
Attributes(NORMAL=4, POSITION=None, TANGENT=5, TEXCOORD_0=6)


```
